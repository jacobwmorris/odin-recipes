            and tomatoes.
            This recipe produces 1 serving.

            <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 grinds black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon water</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded cheese</li>

            <li>
                Crack the eggs into a bowl, then whisk together with kosher salt, pepper, and water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in a nonstick pan just below high heat. wait until the butter starts
                to become foamy with large bubbles but not yet browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in eggs, and cook for 10 to 15 seconds, until a skin begins to form.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cheese and filling ingredients. Push a spatula under the far edge of the egg,
                then pull up and shake the pan to spread out the remaining uncooked egg.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll the eggs over the cheese, and cook another 10 to 15 seconds. The outside should be pale
                golden brown and the inside should be soft and creamy.
            </li>

                Remove omelette from pan, folding it over itself into a rolled shape.
